I am a dedicated researcher in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, specializing primarily in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While my formal education defines me as a Data Scientist, deep down I'm still a Statistician. My passion lies in the world of data, particularly the art of Data Visualization, where I make use of my creativity to transform intricate information into captivating visual narratives. Python and R are my trusty companions in the programming world, having been the bedrock of my academic journey and the tools through which I've brought numerous projects and prototypes to life. What truly fuels my enthusiasm for this work is the opportunity to blend innovative ideas with established methodologies, resulting in ingenious solutions that address a diverse range of challenges in novel and highly efficient ways.
