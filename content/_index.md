              Responsibilities include:

              * Analysis and research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for extracting information from italian legal data as part of the *DataLake* project funded by the Italian Ministry of Justice.
              * Development and implementation through a web application of models based on Large Language Models for tasks such as Entity Typing, Named Entity Recognition, Mention Clustering and others similar tasks. My solutions have led to a highly appreciated improvement in the quality of results obtained, especially compared to the models previously used.
              * Use of major python libraries for deep learning in NLP field such as *Pytroch*, *Pytorch Lightning* and *HuggingFace*.
              * Collaborating with a team of fellow researchers, PhD students and professors.
              * Actively participating in coordinating and organizing efforts of other early stage research associates.
              * Collaborating with legal experts and other research teams to encourage knowledge exchange and project synergy.
