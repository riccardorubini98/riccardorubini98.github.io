[FANTAORACOLO](https://fantaoracolo-ux9tn8qkjepeujnqdb3xeg.streamlit.app/) is a web application designed to help fantasy football enthusiasts make informed decisions about which players to include in their fantasy teams. It achieves this by analyzing real data and using statistical techniques to recommend the best player choices for your fantasy football lineup, increasing your chances of winning your next match.

Here are the key-components of the project:

**Working Demo Web App:** The project involves creating a functional web application (demo at this [LINK](https://share.streamlit.io/riccardorubini98/fantaoracolo/main/app.py)) where users can access the FANTAORACOLO service. This web app will provide an easy and user-friendly interface for users to input their fantasy football team details and receive personalized player recommendations.

**Web Scraping:** To provide accurate and up-to-date recommendations, FANTAORACOLO performs web scraping. This means it collects football and fantasy football data from various online sources. This data includes player statistics, team performance, and other relevant information necessary to make informed suggestions.

**Business Model Canvas:** The project also includes the development of a business model canvas. This canvas outlines the startup's strategy and plans for the web app. It covers aspects such as target audience, revenue streams, key partners, and channels for reaching users. This canvas serves as a roadmap for the project's growth and sustainability.
