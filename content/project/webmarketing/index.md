The primary goal of this project is to better understand and manage customer churn (when customers stop using our services) and to explore the potential impact of mail marketing in reducing churn rates.

Project Components:

1. **Anti-Churn Model:**
We will build a specialized model known as an "anti-churn model." This model helps us predict the likelihood of each customer leaving our company's services. By analyzing various factors, such as customer behavior and engagement, we can estimate the probability that a customer might stop using our products or services.

2. **RFM Segmentation:**
In addition to the anti-churn model, we will use a technique called "RFM segmentation." RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value. This segmentation method helps us identify our most valuable customers based on how recently they made a purchase, how often they do so, and how much money they spend. Understanding these high-value customers is crucial for targeted marketing efforts.

3. **Mail Marketing Analysis:**
We will also investigate the effectiveness of mail marketing campaigns in reducing customer churn rates. This involves sending promotional materials or offers to customers via physical mail. We will analyze whether these mail marketing efforts have a positive impact on retaining customers and if they can help decrease churn.

**Project Benefits:**

**Improved Customer Retention:** By identifying customers at risk of leaving and high-value customers, we can implement strategies to keep valuable clients and reduce churn. Our strategy provides a 20% increase in performance over the classical approach
**Cost-Efficient Marketing:** The analysis of mail marketing effectiveness will help us determine whether this traditional marketing approach is worth the investment in retaining customers.
**Data-Driven Decisions:** The project will rely on data analysis to make informed decisions, ensuring our marketing efforts are targeted and efficient.
