In this project, we conducted an analysis and forecasting of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions using a combination of statistical and deep learning techniques. We explored various modeling approaches, including AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, Unobserved Components Model (UCM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural networks, to select the most suitable model. Our final selected model achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 12%, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting CO emissions
